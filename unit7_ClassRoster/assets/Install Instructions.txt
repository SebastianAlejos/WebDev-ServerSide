To get the Class Roster example working, extract the zip file and put it where you can access it through localhost. Then you need to perform the following:
1. Install the Student Course Database using the "Student Course Database.sql" file.
2. Using phpmyadmin, create a user and password that the application can use to access 
   the StudentCourse database.
    a. Once the database has been created, log into phpmyadmin and click on the 
       StudentCourse database.
    b. Click the Privileges tab, then find the "Add user account" link below the 
       "New" label, then provide the following:
        User name: 291web
        Host name: click Local
        Password: Ni6mPMrgGCau6GX4
        Re-type: Ni6mPMrgGCau6GX4
    c. Go to the bottom of the page and click "Go"

In your browser, navigate to the public_html folder of the unit6_ClassRoster and it should be functional.
